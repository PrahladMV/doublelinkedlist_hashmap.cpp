# doublelinkedlist_hashmap.cpp
Design a data structure for LRU Cache. It should support the following operations: get and set.  get(key) – Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1. set(key, value) – Set or insert the value if the key is not already present.
